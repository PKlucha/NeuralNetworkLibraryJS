# NeuralNetworkLibraryJS
## Neural Network with only one hidden layer.
### Can be used for many simple tasks, but don't expect too much. More layers should be implemented soon enough.

### It uses matrix calculations, so it's preety fast, despite no actual optimalization. Therefore it performs quite good in population based algorithms (where NN is member of larger population. Genetic or Evolution algorithms).

## Feel free to use the code or contribute to this repository.
